### Generating the data set

### Preprocessing and loading



## Running the benchmark

To run the scripts of benchmark framework, edit the `driver/{create-validation-parameters,validate,benchmark}.properties` files,
then run their script, one of:

```bash
driver/create-validation-parameters.sh
driver/validate.sh
driver/benchmark.sh
```

> **Warning:** Note that if the default workload contains updates which are persisted in the database. Therefore, the database needs to be re-loaded between steps â€“ otherwise repeated updates would insert duplicate entries.*
